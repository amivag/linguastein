# Changelog

Notable changes to Linguastein, newest first. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions are
[semver](https://semver.org/).

The version in `package.json` is the single source of truth: the build injects it,
Settings displays it as `Linguastein <version> (<commit>)`, and that is the string a bug
report should quote. Content packs version independently — `core-es` carries its
own version in `pack.json`, shown next to the app's.

This file records changes to the **app**. The full feature inventory and what is
planned next live in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md); dataset growth is visible
in the pack's own counts.

## Unreleased

`0.1.0-alpha.1` — an alpha, untagged. Everything below is what a first release
would contain. Breaking changes are expected between alphas, including to stored
learner state, and are not called out individually until 0.1.0 is tagged.

### Added

- Practice loop with six exercise kinds derived from content, never stored:
  listen & repeat, reveal, think & say, multiple choice, cloze choice, tap to
  build.
- FSRS scheduling, exercise composition that climbs recognition → cued recall →
  production, and derived word- and pattern-level mastery.
- Sessions fully described by their URL, so one can be resumed, shared or driven
  by an agent.
- Browse, reading view with passages, progress, and grouped settings.
- Browsing and practising by thematic category. Topics are a controlled
  vocabulary declared in `content/es/topics.tsv` and shipped in the pack
  manifest with a label and display group, so the build rejects an unregistered
  topic and the picker can show "Days of the week" rather than `days-of-week`.
  Numbers, telling the time, days of the week, months and colours became real
  categories in the process — mostly by classifying sentences that already
  existed.
- Generated `core-es` A1–A2 pack, built from TSV sources with stable item ids and
  editorial sign-off machinery. Marked `source: generated, review: unreviewed`.
- Offline-capable installable PWA: app shell and datasets precached, audio cached
  on first play, all learner state local to the device.
- In-app version, build commit and build date, shown in Settings → Data.
- An update prompt: when the service worker has fetched a new build, the app
  offers a reload instead of taking one. See
  [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#updates-and-caching).
- Dark and light themes on a token system, held to WCAG 2.2 AA by axe and
  contrast tests in CI.
- Optional speech-input pronunciation check on speaking exercises.
- Deployment on GitHub Pages that keeps the source private: a push to `main`
  checks, builds and force-pushes only `dist/` to a separate public repository,
  named so that Pages serves it at the domain root and the PWA needs no base path.
  Includes an SPA fallback, a Jekyll opt-out, and `robots.txt` and `<meta>`
  opt-outs for crawlers and model training. Rationale, the setup steps and the
  known rough edges in [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md).

### Changed

- Renamed from Lingo to **Linguastein**, including the IndexedDB database and the
  `linguastein.theme` key. Local practice history from a pre-rename build is
  orphaned rather than migrated — done now, while the only device affected is a
  development one.
- Relicensed from MIT to **AGPL-3.0-only** for the code and **CC BY-SA 4.0** for
  the datasets, copyright amivag. Free and open with attribution, but a modified
  version served to others must publish its source. Contribution sign-off is now
  required ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)) so a future commercial licence
  stays possible.
- Production sourcemaps are off, so the deployed bundle no longer carries the
  original TypeScript.
- "Reset progress" now asks for confirmation before erasing learner history. It
  is irreversible and there is no server copy, so a single mis-tap should not be
  enough.

### Known gaps

- The pack is machine-generated and **not reviewed curriculum**. No item has been
  signed off yet.
- PWA icons are SVG-only, which does not satisfy Chrome's install criteria — the
  app runs offline but will not offer to install. Tracked as roadmap item 7.
