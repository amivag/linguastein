# Changelog

Notable changes to Lingo, newest first. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions are
[semver](https://semver.org/).

The version in `package.json` is the single source of truth: the build injects it,
Settings displays it as `Lingo <version> (<commit>)`, and that is the string a bug
report should quote. Content packs version independently — `core-es` carries its
own version in `pack.json`, shown next to the app's.

This file records changes to the **app**. The full feature inventory and what is
planned next live in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md); dataset growth is visible
in the pack's own counts.

## Unreleased

0.1.0 is in preparation and has not been tagged. Everything below is what a first
release would contain.

### Added

- Practice loop with six exercise kinds derived from content, never stored:
  listen & repeat, reveal, think & say, multiple choice, cloze choice, tap to
  build.
- FSRS scheduling, exercise composition that climbs recognition → cued recall →
  production, and derived word- and pattern-level mastery.
- Sessions fully described by their URL, so one can be resumed, shared or driven
  by an agent.
- Browse, reading view with passages, progress, and grouped settings.
- Generated `core-es` A1–A2 pack, built from TSV sources with stable item ids and
  editorial sign-off machinery. Marked `source: generated, review: unreviewed`.
- Offline-capable installable PWA: app shell and datasets precached, audio cached
  on first play, all learner state local to the device.
- In-app version, build commit and build date, shown in Settings → Data.
- An update prompt: when the service worker has fetched a new build, the app
  offers a reload instead of taking one. See
  [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#updates-and-caching).
- Dark and light themes on a token system, held to WCAG 2.2 AA by axe and
  contrast tests in CI.
- Optional speech-input pronunciation check on speaking exercises.

### Changed

- "Reset progress" now asks for confirmation before erasing learner history. It
  is irreversible and there is no server copy, so a single mis-tap should not be
  enough.

### Known gaps

- The pack is machine-generated and **not reviewed curriculum**. No item has been
  signed off yet.
- PWA icons are SVG-only, which does not satisfy Chrome's install criteria — the
  app runs offline but will not offer to install. Tracked as roadmap item 7.
